    "## Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do some very basic computer vision. We're going to import the MNIST handwritten digits data and $k$NN to predict values (i.e. \"see/read\").\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To load the data, run the following code in a chunk:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from keras.datasets import mnist\n",
    "df = mnist.load_data('minst.db')\n",
    "train,test = df\n",
    "X_train, y_train = train\n",
    "X_test, y_test = test\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `y_test` and `y_train` vectors, for each index `i`, tell you want number is written in the corresponding index in `X_train[i]` and `X_test[i]`. The value of `X_train[i]` and `X_test[i]`, however, is a 28$\\times$28 array whose entries contain values between 0 and 256. Each element of the matrix is essentially a \"pixel\" and the matrix encodes a representation of a number. To visualize this, run the following code to see the first ten numbers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "np.set_printoptions(edgeitems=30, linewidth=100000)\n",
    "for i in range(5): \n",
    "    print(y_test[i],'\\n') # Print the label\n",
    "    print(X_test[i],'\\n') # Print the matrix of values\n",
    "    plt.contourf(np.rot90(X_test[i].transpose())) # Make a contour plot of the matrix values\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "OK, those are the data: Labels attached to handwritten digits encoded as a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the shape of `X_train` and `X_test`? What is the shape of `X_train[i]` and `X_test[i]` for each index `i`? What is the shape of `y_train` and `y_test`?\n",
    "3. Use Numpy's `.reshape()` method to covert the training and testing data from a matrix into an vector of features. So, `X_test[index].reshape((1,784))` will convert the $index$-th element of `X_test` into a $28\\times 28=784$-length row vector of values, rather than a matrix. Turn `X_train` into an $N \\times 784$ matrix $X$ that is suitable for scikit-learn's kNN classifier where $N$ is the number of observations and $784=28*28$ (you could use, for example, a `for` loop).\n",
    "4. Use the reshaped `X_test` and `y_test` data to create a $k$-nearest neighbor classifier of digit. What is the optimal number of neighbors $k$? If you can't determine this, play around with different values of $k$ for your classifier.\n",
    "5. For the optimal number of neighbors, how well does your predictor perform on the test set? Report the accuracy, compute a confusion matrix, and explain your findings.\n",
    "6. For your confusion matrix, which mistakes are most likely? Do you find any interesting patterns?\n",
    "7. So, this is how computers \"see.\" They convert an image into a matrix of values, that matrix becomes a vector in a dataset, and then we deploy ML tools on it as if it was any other kind of tabular data. To make sure you follow this, invent a way to represent a color photo in matrix form, and then describe how you could convert it into tabular data. (Hint: RGB color codes provide a method of encoding a numeric value that represents a color.)"

    "The code for this is in the box below this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This code was run in the mnist_knn_lab.py file.\n",
    "2. X_train.shape and X_test.shape are (60000, 28, 28) and (10000, 28, 28) respectively. X_train[i].shape and X_test[i].shape are (28, 28). y_train.shape and y_test.shape are (60000,) and (10000,) respectively.\n",
    "3. This was done in the mnist_knn_lab.py file.\n",
    "4. The optimal number of neighbors k is 3.\n",
    "5. The test accuracy is at 97.18%. This means about 97.18% of the 10000 test digits were classifed properly. There is around 282 errors because 1 - 0.9718 is equal to 0.0283. 0.0283 multipled by 10000 is equal to 283. \n",
    "6. For the confusion matrix, the most likely errors are row 2, column 7: 14 times; row 3, column 5: 13 times; row 8, column 3: 13 times; row 9, column 4: 9 times; row 2, column 0: 9 times; row 7, column 1: 18 times; and row 4, column 9: 19 times. An interesting pattern was that most mistakes occured between digits that look around the same in handwriting. This included 4 and 9, 7 and 1, 3 and 5, 8 and 3, and 2 and 7. This confirms that kNN relies on pixels and not actually knowing what digits are.\n",
    "7. Color photos are stored in 3D arrays. The arrays are structured as [Height, Width, Color Channels]. The first two dimensions represent the pixel positions on the screen. The third dimension represents the color components which are red, green, and blue (RGB). Each color component (R, G, and B) contains a value from 0 to 255 for each pixel which determines the intensity of the color. To convert this to tabular data, a method similar to mnist could be used. The [Height, Width, Color Channels] array can be converted to a vector of length H * W * 3. Each image becomes one row in a dataset. Columns represent pixel-channel features. "
